# Detection of 2D Geometric Shapes

The main goal of this project is to detect 2D geometric shapes using tensorflow and python.

## Step 1: Creating a github project (Completed)


## Step 2: Poetry Project


## Step 3: Create a dataset with 2D shapes, partial occlusions

(Need to brainstorm and identify the requirements)


## Step 4: Create a model for predicting geometric shapes

(Need to brainstorm and identify the requirements)


A problem well defined is a problem half solved!
