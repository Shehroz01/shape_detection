# Detection of 2D Geometric Shapes

The main goal of this project is to detect 2D geometric shapes using tensorflow and python.


## Step 1: Creating a github project (Completed)

Created and shared with the team.


## Step 2: Poetry Project

* Why Poetry?
* What do I need to know about Poetry?
* How does it work with Windows?

## Step 3: Setup a tensorflow machine learning project


## Step 4: Create a dataset with 2D shapes, partial occlusions

(Need to brainstorm and identify the requirements)


## Step 5: Create a model for predicting geometric shapes

(Need to brainstorm and identify the requirements)


A problem well defined is a problem half solved!
